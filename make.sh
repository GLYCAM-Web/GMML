#Proper cmake use is to use the build_type flag. We mess with specifics in the
# actual cmakelists.txt file. Listed below are the different build types in
# normal english. Ty stack overflow

#1. Release: high optimization level, no debug info, code or asserts.
#2. Debug: No optimization, asserts enabled, [custom debug (output) code enabled],
#   debug info included in executable (so you can step through the code with a
#   debugger and have address to source-file:line-number translation).
#3. RelWithDebInfo: optimized, *with* debug info, but no debug (output) code or asserts.
#4. MinSizeRel: same as Release but optimizing for size rather than speed.

#Below are the compiler flags passed for each build type before they were
# overloaded in our cmakelists.txt
#1. Release: `-O3 -DNDEBUG`
#2. Debug: `-O0 -g`
#3. RelWithDebInfo: `-O2 -g -DNDEBUG`
#4. MinSizeRel: `-Os -DNDEBUG`

#Below are what we changed the compiler flags to
#1. Release: `-O2 -DNDEBUG`
#2. Debug: `-O0 -g`
#3. RelWithDebInfo: `-O0 -DNDEBUG`	(This is our non-optimized build)
#4. MinSizeRel: `` 					(NOT USED)
#Note that our debug symbols are only available with non-optimized flags, this is
#intentional.
