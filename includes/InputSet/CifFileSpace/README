CIF (crystallographic information format) filespace holds all of the code written by the PDB to handle CIF and mmCIF files

see http://mmcif.wwpdb.org/docs/sw-examples/cpp/html/index.html to update these files

The files have been modified to match the formatting of gmml (.hpp and .cc files) as well as fixing the filepaths to work with our architecture
