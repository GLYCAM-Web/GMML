The GLYCAM Molecular Modeling Library (GMML) is typically used as a library accessed by GEMS (GLYCAM Extensible Modeling Script).

To get started, follow the [Download and Install](http://glycam.org/docs/gems/download-and-install/ "Download and Install") instructions. These instructions will walk you through the steps to obtain and configure the software, and also test the installation. 

Once the software is installed and tested, you can move on to [Writing Your Own GEMS](http://glycam.org/docs/gems/writing-your-own-gems/ "Writing Your Own GEMS"), or you can use the [existing GEMS](http://glycam.org/docs/gems/using-existing-gems/ "Existing GEMS") that come with the software by default. 

More information about GEMS can be found here:
