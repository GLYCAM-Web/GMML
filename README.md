The GLYCAM Molecular Modeling Library (GMML) was designed to be used as a library accessed by GEMS (GLYCAM Extensible Modeling Script), but can be used as a standalone library.

More information about GEMS can be found here:

Website:  [http://glycam.org/gems](http://glycam.org/gems "GLYCAM GEMS")  
Github:  [https://github.com/GLYCAM-Web/gems](https://github.com/GLYCAM-Web/gems "GLYCAM GEMS - Github")

To get started, follow the [Download and Install](http://glycam.org/docs/gems/download-and-install/ "Download and Install") instructions. These instructions will walk you through the steps to obtain and configure the software, and also test the installation.

To compile and use the programs that are based on gmml (e.g. the carbohydrate or glycoprotein builders) go to their subfolders (e.g. internalPrograms/GlycoproteinBuilder/) and follow the compilation instructions in the readme there.
